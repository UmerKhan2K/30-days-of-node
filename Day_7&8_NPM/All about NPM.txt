What is package.json
package.json is a way to manage the locally installed packages.
package.json serves as documentation on which our project depends.
It is kind of a directory which keeps track of all the dependencies our project is using.
It allows us to specify the versions of packages our project is using. This is achieved using semantic versioning rules.
Create package.json : We can create package.json file using the npm init command.

npm init --yes (to say yes to all queries)

Installing a package:
npm install < package_name >
npm install -g < package_name > (for global install)
npm install express@4.15.1 (to install a specific version of npm)

npm uninstall gannit (uninstall a package)
